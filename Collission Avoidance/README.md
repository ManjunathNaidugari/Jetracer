# Collision Avoidance

The objective of this repository is to implement a collision avoidance scenario using the JetRacer, drawing inspiration from the approach developed for the Jetbot robot, which enables it to stay within a rectangular area and navigate around obstacles.

Achieving collision avoidance with the JetRacer Pro AI Kit presents a significant challenge due to the fundamental differences between the JetRacer car and the [Jetbot robot](https://www.waveshare.com/jetbot-2gb-ai-kit.htm).

*Jetbot Robot Characteristics:*

- **Two-Wheeled Design**: The Jetbot robot utilizes a two-wheeled configuration, enabling it to achieve omnidirectional movement.
- **Direct Obstacle Avoidance**: This omnidirectional capability allows the Jetbot to directly circumvent obstacles by simply steering in the desired direction.

*JetRacer Car Characteristics:*

- **Four-Wheeled Design**: The JetRacer car employs a four-wheeled configuration, limiting its steering angle.
- ** Obstacle Avoidance**: Our goal is to detect an obstacle, avoid it by going around it and then returning back to the regular trackâ€‹

These differences necessitate a more cautious approach to training the JetRacer for collision avoidance. Alternative strategies may also be required to compensate for its limited maneuverability.
